# Sound Level Meter

# Description
This Arduino project uses a strip of LEDs to indicate how loud the surrounding noise is. As the sound level increases, the LEDs change color (green for low noise, yellow for moderate, and red for loud), creating a visual representation of the sound intensity.
It also includes a WiFi module that transmits the data collected by the microphone to a laptop/phone, where the recorded values ​​are displayed.
